# Introduction

this is a service for data transformation based on node-red.
the idea is that the provider offers "node-red service" as a resource. One consumer can request a resource then submit workflows to the resource to perform data transformation. Therefore during runtime, such resouces can be used for interoperability.

Supported by the Inter-IoT.
