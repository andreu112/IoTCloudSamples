# Some utilities

We have some utilities for testing purposes.

Conversion programs are used to convert real data from one form to another form for data preparation for tests

* valenciaport-data-json-csv.py : convert json data to csv

Generator programs are used to generate fake data (e.g. based on realistic model) in cases we do not have enough data for tests:

* valenciaport-data-emissionCabins-generator.js: as one example for generating data for testing
