# Service Unit Connectors
Given that we have many units, developed by us or by others, for tests, we need to work some code to implement some logics. This directory provides some connectors/libraries for some integration cases.

## Lighting in Inter-IoT port

In Inter-IoT tests, it is possible to send some commands to turn on and off lights via Inter-IoT Middleware. We provide a library for doing this.

## Semantics Service

In Inter-IoT tests, one can send data to an existing semantics service for transformation, we provide a library for calling the semantic services so that you can use it with other services.
