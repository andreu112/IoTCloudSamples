# IoT Cloud Samples
## Introduction
This collection includes different types of IoT units, samples of IoT Cloud Systems, data, and testing scenarios for different purposes. The work is partially supported by the [H2020 U-test project](http://www.u-test.eu) and the [H2020 Inter-IoT](http://www.inter-iot-project.eu/) and also is benefited from our collaboration with industries, who share use cases and data. 

Our goal for this project is to provide open source samples that one can use for different purposes.

## Sensors

>>>>>>> cf2a084da5f96bbcb85c514781a0e9c861775c32
- emulated sensors and real sensors
- sensors using Things-specific APIs to monitor Things
- sensors using Software-defined Gateways API to monitor Things
- sensors using different cloud connectivity types to send data to Cloud/Gateways
- sensors running in different environments (bare OS, docker, vagrant, etc.)
- sensors running in a single node (emulated or real)
- sensors running within a topology (creating a network of sensors)
## IoT Cloud example
- BTS monitoring
## Data
- real data from monitoring real BTS
## Testing Scenarios
- for testing uncertainty
- for testing incidents
